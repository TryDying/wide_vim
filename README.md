## Installation

Run `install.sh -h` to view the options.

Here is `-a`  for all plugins I have used, and `-s` for a mini set and `-n` to configure vim with
out any plugins.

## Enviroment

Generally, use `neovim >=0.4.0` or `vim >=8.2` to get the `install.sh` work out of box.
Of course, some plugins like `coc.nvim` need `nodejs>=12.04` and `python3 support` for vim.

You should write some code to check whether the vim works as your expectation, and then to
decide how to patch your environment.

As a reference, I get all plugins work on my desktop running an Manjaro OS, and use two third of
them on laptop, and none for VPS, because too much plugins could cause lags.
